# FunnyGIFS
The application allows a user to search for gifs by entering a search term. Gifs can be added and or deleted to a favourites page that stay unique to the users device. The gifs are still on load and can be animated on click.

# Under the Hood
This app fetches gifs from the GIPHY.com API using an Ajax request. LocalStorage and SessionStorage are used to save gifs and searches respectively.
